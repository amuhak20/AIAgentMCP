# AIAgentMCP-framework Workspace Coding Guidelines

All code written or modified in this repository must adhere to the following rules.

---

## 1. Page Object Pattern
* **Base Class:** All page objects (except `BasePage`) must extend `BasePage` and pass `page` to `super(page)`.
  * *Reference file:* [base.page.ts](file:///Users/raneeshchoudhary/projects/ai_code_review_demo/pages/base.page.ts)
* **Properties:** Define all locators as `readonly` class properties in the `constructor`.
* **Selector Priority:** `data-test` attributes > `id` > ARIA roles. Never use CSS classes or xpath.
* **Pure Interaction:** Never place assertions (`expect`) inside page objects. They must only contain interaction and helper methods.
* **Methods:** Define methods only for multi-step interactions. Keep page object APIs clean and focused.
* **Naming & Export:** Class names must be `[Name]Page` and use named exports (e.g. `export class CartPage`).

---

## 2. Test Conventions
* **Naming Format:** Every test must start with a Jira/Test ID prefix (scoped per feature file) and include the `@regression` tag.
  * *Example:* `test('C01 add product appears in cart @regression', async ({ ... }) => { ... })`
* **Assertion Messages:** Every `expect` statement must include a custom explanation message.
  * *Example:* `await expect(rows, 'cart should show 1 item after add').toHaveCount(1);`
* **Structure (AAA):** Arrange / Act / Assert. Use `beforeEach` hooks for shared navigation and authentication/setup. Ensure each test is self-contained regarding the data it owns/creates.
* **Rule of Three (DRY):** Only extract code to helper functions or fixtures if it is duplicated in 3 or more places.
* **Fixture Encapsulation:** Tests must always use custom Playwright fixtures (e.g., `{ homePage, cartPage }` from `../../fixtures`) instead of manually instantiating page objects inside tests (`new HomePage(page)`).
* **Navigation:** Use the page object's `navigate()` method (which inherits from `BasePage` and handles `networkidle` state) rather than calling raw `page.goto()` inside tests.

## 3. Banned Patterns

| Banned Pattern | Replace with |
|---|---|
| `page.waitForTimeout()` | Explicit locator waits with `{ timeout }` or state-based waits (e.g., `await expect(locator).toBeVisible({ timeout: 5000 })`). |
| Hardcoded strings in tests | Import constants from `data/products.ts` or `data/users.ts`. |
| CSS class-based or xpath selectors | `data-test` attributes or ARIA roles (e.g. `getByRole`). |
| Inline locator queries inside test specs | Every element interaction must go through a Page Object property or method to maintain separation of concerns. (e.g., no `page.locator(...)` or `page.getByRole(...)` inside `.spec.ts` files). |
| Assertions inside Page Objects | Move all `expect` into test files. |

---

## 4. Test IDs
IDs (C01, C02...) are scoped per feature file and map to Jira tickets.  
When writing new tests: scan the existing file for the highest ID, increment by 1.

---

## 5. Flaky Test Policy
* Fix root cause immediately. Do not skip or silence flaky tests unless absolutely quarantined.
* If writing a step that is potentially timing-sensitive, add a comment flag:
  `// NOTE: waitForLoadState may be flaky under slow network — watch in CI`
